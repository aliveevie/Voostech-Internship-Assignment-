Exercise 1: Basics
Write a Python program that takes the name of the user as an input and prints "Hello, user-name".
Write a Python program to determine the grade of a student in a course given his/her score using if, el-if and else statements. (70-100=A, 60-69=B, 50-59=C, 40-49=D, <40=F).
Modify the program in (2) to print the full meaning of each grade point as follows (A=Excellent, B=Very good, C=Good, D=Pass and F= Fail).
Write a program to print all even numbers between 1 and 100 using: while and for loop
Modify the program in (4) to store the even numbers in a list.
Print the content of the list created in (5) using: while and for statements.
Extract the logic for printing the content of the list in (6) into a separate function. Call the function from your main method/function.
Write a function that received 3 arguments. Adds up the first two arguments and store the result in the 3rd argument. Explore the concept of mutable and immutable types. Print the result of the addition inside the main method.
Write a program to create and print the content of a 2x2 matrix using for and while loop.
Write a program to perform matrix addition of 2 square matrices (use 2x2 matrices for simplicity)
Exercise 2: OOP
Create a class of type Vehicle with the following fields: name, make, price and function details that prints the properties separated by a comma.
Alter the above class, make the fields private and create properties for accessing them.
Create an instance of the class in your main method and print its content.
Create a method that takes the Vehicle object as an argument.
Alter the Vehicle object inside the method. Print the object inside the method as well as inside the main method. Do you notice any difference? What do you think is the best way of handling this?
Create an application to manage food orders for KFC. The application should have the following classes:
User (for user information) with fields: name(string), address(string)
Food (for keeping a record of foods) with fields: name(string), price (float), size (small, medium and large).
Order (for keeping the order) with fields user(User), food(list of Foods), getTotal(function to compute total amount for all foods).
In the main method, create some users, food items, and create an order for at least one user with at least 2 food items.
Print the order information. Use the attached image for reference
Exercise 3: OOP Advanced
Create a class Car inheriting from the Vehicle class with additional fields: tank size, mpg
Create another class Bicycle inheriting from Vehicle with a field pedal speed.
Create a method speed in the classes Vehicle, Car and Bicycle.
Instantiate the Car and Bicycle class in your main method and test the concept of method overriding
Create another class called HybridBike that inherits from Car and Bicycle. the class should have the field: numberOfExhaust;
Instantiate the HybridBike class in your main and print its content.
Convert the Vehicle class into an interface/abstract class. Define two methods namely: drive and brake.
Enforce the implementation of the methods in the sub-classes
Exercise 4: Exception Handling and File Operation
Write a python program to calculate the lines number in a file, a.txt.
Write a python program to read a file, a.txt line by line and append the content to another file b.txt
Write a function in Python to count and display the total number of words in a text file.
Write a program to read the content of all the text files in a given directory (provided by the user via command line), and merge the contents into a single file whose name is also provided by the user via command line.
Read and write python objects to a file using the Pickle library
A binary file "STUDENT.DAT" has a structure (admission_number, Name, Percentage). Write a function count_rec() in python that would read the contents of the file "STUDENT.DAT" and display the details of those students whose percentage is above 75. Also, display number of students scoring above 75%
Develop a custom exception class with 2 subclasses handling different types of exceptions. All the classes should contain an error code. The child classes should contain a unique specification code and error messages.
Raise the exceptions within your code and handle them appropriately
Challenge: Programming Challenge [You will win a prize if you are able to complete this]
Use your creativity to build a compression client that takes the folder path, zips the content of the folder, and produces a compressed file (e.g. documents.zip)
